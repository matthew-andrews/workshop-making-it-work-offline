# Introduction

Today we're going to explore all the technologies available in browsers today that can be brought together to build **offline websites**.

## Me

- Core dev FT web app, Economist HTML5 app (both successful offline-first applications)
- Author of tutorial series: [How to make an offline HTML5 web app, FT style](http://labs.ft.com/2012/08/basic-offline-html5-web-app/)
- [Building A Simple Cross-Browser Offline To-Do List With IndexedDB And WebSQL on Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/09/02/building-simple-cross-browser-offline-todo-list-indexeddb-websql/)

## You

- Introduction yourselves
- How would you describe your JavaScript skills?
- What do you hope to gain from today? (Mostly to learn about techniques to use today, or one that will be usable in a few month's time?)

## Course structure

The structure of this course will be very practical and hands-on focused on building prototypes, and will typically follow this pattern:

- Hack something together that works.
- Talk about why it works (explaining any browser APIs that we've used that may be unfamiliar).
- Discuss why it's inefficient or inelegant and then improve on it.
- There are exercises at the end of many sections if you finish the core material quickly.
- Schedule for the day: 9 start, 10.30 break (½ hour), 12.30 lunch (1 hour), 15.00 break (½ hour), 17.00 the end.

## What you should get out of today's course

- A few working prototypes.
- All the prototypes are on my GitHub (publicly so if you have any problems with any after today - please feel free to raise issues there and I will try to find time to help)
