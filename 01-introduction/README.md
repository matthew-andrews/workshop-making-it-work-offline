# Introduction

Today we're going to explore all the technologies available in browsers today that can be brought together to build **offline websites**.

## Course structure

The structure of this course will be very practical, focused on building prototypes, and will typically follow this pattern:

- Hack something together that works.
- Talk about why it works (explaining any browser APIs that we've used that may be unfamiliar).
- Discuss why it's inefficient or inelegant and then improve on it.
- There are bonus exercises at the end of each section if you find the core material not challenging enough.
